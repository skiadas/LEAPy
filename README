LEAP Placement program

Main file: LEAPy.py
Needs 3 input files:
    - Student list from Jan converted to *OLD EXCEL* format, current one saved under LEAPFiles/math_leap2.xls (Line 8 in script)
    - Placement scores taken from doing an export from placementtester (line 9 in script)
        - Go to Gradebook -> Class Grades
        - Select Hanover Exam from list and click Search
        - Select StudentID, deselect Total points, Refresh View
        - Export to CSV and save with a nice name
        - Possibly edit the file to correct ID numbers for manually-entered students
    - Optional: Student rooms list in *OLD EXCEL* format. 
                If not available yet, then comment out lines 31 and 32 of LEAPy.py
Output files:
    - HTML and Excel output sheets, mostly for checking (lines 16, 17)
    - Placement file in the format to be sent to Jan (line 20)
    - LaTeX file with the letters (lines 31, 32). Will require using LaTeX on the resulting file, to produce pdf output.


Other important files:
  - [PlacementCodeSummaries.tex] Contains a summary of the placement codes. Should be updated if those codes and their meaning change.
  - [placement_instructions.txt] Contains instructions on how to perform the placement. This is where changes to the placement should be done. Documentation on it in placement_instructions.rst or also under _build/html/placement_instructions.html
  - [templates] Folder containing template files for the letters. Only tex_letter_template.tex and tex_letter_template_barb.tex are relevant. Change those if you want to customize the letters.
